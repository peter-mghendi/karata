# karata
Real-time Kenyan street poker over ASP.NET Core SignalR/websockets.

The game is currently playable but does not implement all of the game logic yet.

There is also a custom cards library [here](https://github.com/sixpeteunder/karata/tree/main/src/Karata.Cards) (with a complete test suite) that I intend to publish to NuGet as soon as possible.
